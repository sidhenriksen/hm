This repository provides Matlab code for an interactive visualization of data we have collected
from V1 neurons in the macaque brain. Running PlotCurated.m will bring up an interactive plot.
Each point in the plot corresponds to a cell, clicking on the cell will bring up the tuning curves
of that cell to correlated, anti-correlated and half-matched random dot stereograms. Half-matched
random dot stereograms were introduced in Doi et al. (2011, 2013, 2014).

For each point, the dot size corresponds to the magnitude of the disparity discrimination index (DDI).
The DDI tells you how disparity tuned a neuron is. The different colors correspond to different
sessions. These data are from two monkeys (lem and jbe); data from monkey jbe is shown as square
points, data from monkey lem is shown as circular points.
